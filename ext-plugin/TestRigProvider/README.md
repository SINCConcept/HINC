# Test Rig Provider Example

It is an INTER-HINC example that deals with IoT devices from  a Test Rig Provider
which provides various IoT devices from a test rig. The test rig is 
provided via a REST based Web service provider. We have a real test rig 
service provided by Nordic MedTest in the U-test project.

To emulate a real test rig service, we also develop a test rig simulator 
web service. The simulator is available at: https://github.com/rdsea/IoTCloudSamples/tree/master/IoTCloudUnits/testRig


The goal is to support interoperability of IoT w.r.t accessing 
and controlling IoT devices in the test rig.

## Metadata integration model

we use pull-based model in which plugins will access the Test Rig
API
 
## Support 

The test rig is provided by the U-Test, while 
the work is about interoperability of IoT in INTER-HINC
