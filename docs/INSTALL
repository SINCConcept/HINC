Simple installation of HINC

1)Build the code by using maven

2)Setup a local management service with a specific provider
The Local Management Service is standalone .jar achive. It requires a set of plug-ins (also .jar) to interface with providers. 
Currently, plug-in is load via Java ClassPath. The steps are followings:
 - Copy the local-management-service-1.0.jar and needed the plug-in in to a same folder.
 - Write and place the configuration files in the same folder, see examples of info-sources.conf and hinc.conf
 - Run the command: java -cp "*.jar" sinc.hinc.local.Main

3)Setup communication middleware

 - The underlying communication is AMQP. We need to install a RabbitMQ server. In Ubuntu, simply run command:

$ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

You can also use a free RabbitMQ from CloudAMQP (cloudamqp.com)

The IP/URL of the RabbitMQ server is put into the hinc.conf file. 


4)Setup global management service
The Global Management Service is embedded with the client, which can be execute via command line or using as a Java library for programming.
TODO: Develop the client.

5)Add new local management service 

Adding a new Local Management Service to interface with a new provider including implement following interfaces:
 - RawInfoCollector: to collect raw information from provider APIs or data sources.
 - GatewayResourceTransformationInterface: to transform SD Gateway information.
 - RouterResourceTranformationInterface: to transform Router information.
 
6)Test the installation
