---


## Overview

---

rsiHub (Resource Slice Interoperability) implements some concepts  of [the SINC Concept](http://sincconcept.github.io) by interfacing to different providers to obtain resource metadata, control resources and establish resource slices. rsiHub is  [HINC](hinc) for harmonizing IoT, network functions and cloud resources, Slice Resource Management, and Interoperability Recommendation Service. rsiHub is an evolution of HINC and other work in the SINC Concept.

HINC work is initially supported by the [H2020 U-Test](www.u-test.eu) and rsiHub currently is supported by the [H2020 Inter-IoT](http://www.inter-iot-project.eu/) through the subproject INTER-HINC.  

Download the [rsiHub source code from Github](https://github.com/SINCConcept/HINC) and play with it.
