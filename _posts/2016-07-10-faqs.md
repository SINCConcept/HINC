**1. How can HINC manages devices without a gateway involved? These devices send data directly to cloud, no HINC local can be deployed at the edge**

> HINC Local Management Service can be deployed on edge or cloud, thus there is no limitation in the deployment topology. HINC Local Service requires an interface with the devices to capture raw data and to harmonize information. Therefore, a HINC-enabled device need to expose its capabilities regardless the infrastructure configuration.

**2. Does HINC Local Management overload the edge-devices?**

> HINC Local only processes the metadata of the resources without dealing with the actual sensoring data from sensors or control actions of actuators. The number of resources will reduce the performance of the device, for sure, but in trade-off the hightlight features as introduced. The meta information is monitored at a rate or via pushing mechanism for the best performance.

**3. Why HINC Local is a must have component?**

> For edge-to-edge communication, HINC Local provides a distributed computation model. For example, multiple control services can analyze data and cooperate with each other to control a set of dynamic devices.
