HINC architecture is fully distributed, which mean each components can run individually. At runtime, two types of components can be run:
<ul>
<li> Local Management Services: To interface with providers to tranform the information and send the control.
</li>
<li> Global Management Services: To interface with providers to tranform the information and send the control.
</li>
</ul>

<p> The system that HINC aim to manage include following components:
<ul>
  <li>Cloud provider: can be private cloud like Openstack, or public service like AmazonEC2.
  <li>Network provider: cooporate with NFV provider such as OpenDaylight, OpenBaton.
  <li>IoT provider: manage edge services/platform such as IoTivity, OpenHAB
</ul>


<p>We are setting up a testbed to further developing HINC, which is shown in the figure below. The testbed will be spread in distributed sites: in Vienna, in Hanoi and several public service (AmazonEC, CloudAMQP). We aim to demonstrate the ability to manage distributed and large scale system and network.</p>
